# Solar Simulation - learn science like never before

## üî≠ About:

This central concept of this project is about learning Astronomy because it is the core of physics and science. And with better understanding of science, we would begin to realize that "learning science" is not just about exams scores; it's about discovering how it intertwines with our daily lives.

This is particularly true in Southeast Asia, where I come from, as there's often a lack of curiosity and motivation when it comes to learning science. However, it's important to realize that a solid foundation in science plays a pivotal role in building a more sustainable economy, alleviating poverty, and ultimately elevating our quality of life.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Design Rationale:

Although SceneKit primarily handled planet modeling, I'd like to underscore the central role of ARKit in this Playground. Augmented Reality was specifically chosen for this project as it would help set the perfect stage for a more immersive learning experience - allowing children to engage with abstract physics concepts through real-world interaction.

## üìå Design Objectives:

**1. Introducing Kids to Coding**

We allow the kids to explore the Solar System by tweaking the codebase, making mistakes and eventually learning from them. In this particular playground, users/kids are able to code and manipulate:

 * The size of each individual planet
 * The planet rotation speed around its centre of mass
 * The planet rotation speed around Sun as the centre of rotation  
 * The distance between planets in the solar system
  
Children learn about the concepts of rotational motion and how it's influenced by the distance from its center of rotation. Rather than simply "teaching" these abstract concepts, this provides opportunities for kids to interact with them, allowing them to learn through hands-on experience.

Children will observe that the planets initially begin their rotation on the same line (x-axis). This deliberate design choice serves to illustrate the concept of orbital speed. Over time, this simulation gradually evolves to mirror an actual solar system.

Children are encouraged to explore by navigating to the farthest planets and back, all from the comfort of their own rooms. Additionally, natural satellites of Earth and Mars are included in the simulation.

**2. Instilling A Love Of Science In Children**

Once the kids have set up the solar system, they may quickly notice that Earth's natural satellite, the Moon, can collide with neighboring planets due to the initial proximity.

Through trial and error, as they adjust the distances by tweaking the codebase, learning takes place. After all, we often learn best through experience.

Children and users gain insights into concepts like rotational speed/velocity and how it's influenced by the distance from the center of rotation. Instead of "teaching" these abstract ideas, we encourage kids to interact with them, allowing learning to occur naturally.

Making learning fun and interactive. Take a look at Earth! üëª

Have you noticed how the planets all begin their rotation on the same line? This design choice is intentional to illustrate the concept of orbital speed. Over time, the simulation gradually evolves to closely resemble an actual solar system.
